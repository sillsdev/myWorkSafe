  <h3>Customization</h3>

  <div>myWorkSafe is basically intended to have zero configuration.&#160; I, as an occasional supporter of language workers, do not have time to individually configure their backup programs. Instead, I want myWorkSafe to embody all the same decisions I would make for a typical native-speaker language worker.&#160; This configuration ships with in the form of a “myWorkSafe.ini” file found in the folder where the application was installed.&#160; For example here are some entries which illustrate many of the options:</div>

  <div>&#160;</div>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">[Paratext] 
      <br />#on 32-bit Windows 

      <br />rootFolder=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\ScrChecks\1.0\Settings_Directory </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">#on 64 bit Windows 
      <br />rootFolder=HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\ScrChecks\1.0\Settings_Directory </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">#in case that registry entry is missing 
      <br />rootFolder=c:\my paratext projects&#160;&#160;&#160; </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">excludeFolder=TNE Notes Database 
      <br />excludeFolder=cms</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">[AdaptIt] 
      <br />rootFolder=$Documents$\AdaptIt Unicode Work 

      <br />#try this one if that one doesn't work 

      <br />rootFolder=$Documents$\AdaptIt Work </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">[WeSay] 
      <br />rootFolder=$MyDocuments$\WeSay 

      <br />excludeFile=*.pdf</font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier">[MyPictures] 
      <br />name = My Pictures 

      <br />rootFolder = $MyPictures$ 

      <br />excludeFolder=Sample Pictures</font></p>

  <div>&#160;</div>

  <div>If you want, you can make different decisions, or just add to myWorkSafe’s smarts, by modifying the “myWorkSafe.ini” found in your appData/local/myWorkSafe (or whatever the equivalent is on that version of Windows).&#160; A blank version of this file is created after the first use of the program.&#160; So, for example, I’m <em>not</em> a typical language worker, so my settings alter things radically (I basically have too much data to ever fit on a USB key, so I limit myWorkSafe to a few key things):</div>

  <div>&#160;</div>

  <div><font class="style2" size="2">#I never would put something I want to backup on the desktop.

      <br />

      <br />[EdoloData] 

      <br />rootFolder = $MyDocuments$ /LanguageData/Edolo

      <br />#I don't want these lock files, either. Note, &quot;*&quot; only works at the beginning of file names, not in directories or other parts of filenames. 

      <br />excludeFile = *.lock 

      <br /></font></div>

  <p>So far, we’ve seen two levels of settings: one comes with the program, and another can override that a user with special needs.&#160; There is a third level: drive-specific settings.&#160; For example, you could have one drive for data, and another for videos.&#160; In my case, I like to get a very small amount of data backed up constantly: my current list of passwords/registrations.&#160; To do that, place a file named, again, “myWorkSafe.ini” inside the folder used for backup on the device; in my case, “f:/myWorkSafe-John-THINKPAD”. Here’s the contents:</p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[Settings] 
      <br /># I don't want this to be affected by myWorkSafe’s factory settings, at all 

      <br />clearAllPreviousSettings </font></p>

  <p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[Passwords] 
      <br />rootFolder= C:\Users\John\Documents\Passwords</font></p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p><font color="#000000">If you find yourself frequently customizing colleague’s myWorkSafe’s, <strong>something is wrong</strong>.&#160; The point is to have enough smarts and domain knowledge to make this unnecessary.&#160; But these configuration abilities should be enough to make the program work for some of us geeks, and we need that to happen, so that myWorkSafe gets a lot of testing.</font></p>

<h3>Known Problems and TroubleShooting</h3>

<h4>What happens When the USB Fills up?</h4>

<p>Q: How does myWorkSafe handle it if a backup fills up a thumb drive, then the next day the translator does more Paratext work and then tries to backup again? Will MP3s, for example, be deleted to make room for the Paratext data?</p>

<p>A: Mws is pretty dumb in this situation. It doesn’t ever delete anything. 
  <br /></p>

<h4>TroubleShooting</h4>

<p>MyWorkSafe stores a log of its recent operations in %temp%/myWorkSafeLog.txt. If you report a problem, please include that file, if you can.</p>

<h4>Microsoft Outlook</h4>

<p>If you'd like to backup Outlook, note that the user must close Outlook before MWS can safely back them up. If you can live with that, you also need to find where the actual Outlook PSTs live. Try</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Courier New">[Outlook]
